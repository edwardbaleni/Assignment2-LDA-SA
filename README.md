The State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa (SONA) is an annual event in which the President of South Africa reports on the status of the nation, generally to the resumption of a joint sitting of Parliament.

The overall goal for this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the content of the speeches using sentiment analysis and topic modelling and to write a short scientific paper (word limit: 4500) that you will host on your own website.
