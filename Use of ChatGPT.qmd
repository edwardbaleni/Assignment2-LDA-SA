title: "Using Chat GPT"
---

ChatGPT, a large language model, was used in this assignment to assisst in identifying problem areas and resolving shortcomings. Various types of requests were submitted; the performance of these requests were variable. This is further explained below.

**Open ended questions/Asking for guidance:**

The first type of questions asked to ChatGPT were broad questions seeking guidance and direction. For example: "What is the best way to perform sentiment analysis of speeches in R?" or "What are the major application areas for sentiment analysis?". In response to these types of questions ChatGPT was quite helpful, offering lists with valueable information, which aided in giving direction on what to do or write about in the report. This included giving steps one could follow in R with associated code, as well as lists of application areas with brief descriptions of how sentiment analysis is applied.

**Providing literature:**

The second task attempted with ChatGPT involved requesting recommendations for academic papers and textbooks to assist in the formation of the literature review. Questions asked were "Can you recommend papers or textbooks on sentiment analysis for the purpose of a literature review?" and "Please also provide some papers for a brief literature review for Topic Modelling? Particularly any papers that have done topic modelling for presidential speeches". While some of the recommended papers proved to be valuable and contained the desired information, certain issues were encountered. In some cases, the suggested papers appeared not to exist, or their authors differed from those specified by ChatGPT. In addition, a number of machine learning papers related to sentiment analysis were recommended, which, while potentially interesting, might not align with the basic sentiment analysis information one might be seeking. To address these challenges, it is essential to provide more specific criteria or instructions in the query to refine the search and obtain more accurate recommendations.

**Assistance with code:**

A number of prompts were given to ChatGPT regarding code and how to fix errors in R or create certain plots. This is one area that ChatGPT performs well in. It is able to take a request and produce chunks of code that execute the task. One area that ChatGPT did not do particularly well in was identifying why a particular error was occurring in R. For example with the S4 objects that are created when an LDA analysis is performed, ChatGPT did not know that the \$ operator cannot be used with S4 objects. Even after providing it the R error which specifies that this is the case, it still failed produce correct code. The prompt had to be modified to specify that this is the case and request the correct operator before ChatGPT was able to give the correct code.

**Assistance with write up:**

The final item tasked to ChatGPT was to assess its ability to aid in writing up some of the report. The tool was prompted to with the introduction of the paper and asked to edit it in a manner that was 'better' for scientific papers. This is one area where it did not perform particularly well. While it is able to write and generate text that makes sense and well structured, the language used is quite 'flowery' and abundant in redundant words. This makes it very obvious that it was written by a Large Language Model as it does not convey the same tone that an academic would have. These responses were not used in the report because the responses were not particularly good.

In summary, it was observed that ChatGPT serves as a valuable tool for generating ideas and code when one is uncertain about a course of action. However, it is essential to exercise caution and not blindly accept all of its suggestions without verification. In addition, some of its suggested 'fixes' may not function as intended, and prompts provided should be specific to guide the Large Language Model in the right direction.
