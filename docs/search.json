    "section": "",
    "text": "Due to the large volume of text data available today, sentiment analysis and topic modelling have become popular methods to classify documents (or other pieces of text) based on their emotional content and topics or themes present. Sentiment analysis and topic modelling methods provide techniques to programmatically categorize documents and does not require individuals to sit and read through large documents. In this report, sentiment analysis and topic modelling is applied to State of the Nation Addresses in South Africa between 1994 and 2023. The sentiment analysis sectiosn allows one to identify different presidents’ sentiments conveyed in their speeches and how this changed over time. Topic modelling highlights what the major themes are that each president speaks about and if the proportion of time spent on each topic changes over time. The results of the sentiment analysis showed that, overall, South African presidents have a net positive sentiment in their speeches. Specifically, Mandela and Mbeki became more positive in their speeches over the time of their presidency while Zuma and Ramaphosa has become less positive during their time in office. These findings correlate with what was happening in South Africa at the times of their respective presidencies. Topic modelling extracted four key topics or themes which were given the following labels: Economic Growth, Social Development, Public Governance and Politics and Administration. The four topics were tracked over time for each president and results show how different presidents’ different speeches contained varying levels of each of these four topics."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe aim of this assignment is to provide a descriptive analysis of the State of the Nation speeches in South Africa between 1994 and 2022. This descriptive analysis is performed using sentiment analysis and topic modelling. Sentiment analysis aims to describe the content of text in terms of its ‘emotions’ (Silge & Robinson, 2017). The purpose of performing sentiment analysis on these speeches is to identify the overall tone or emotion of the speech and identify how this might change over time or as presidents change. Topic modelling is a technique that aims to summarize text, in this case speeches, in terms of a number of topics. It is a way of categorizing speeches into different topics and identifying the main themes of a body of text (Silge & Robinson, 2017). This is of interest in order to identify what topics or themes are important in the context of the government of South Africa and how these themes or main topics may change over time or over different presidents.\nThe rest of the report is structured as follows: a brief literature review is given on descriptive analysis and the research previously done that uses sentiment analysis and topic modelling to analyse presidential speeches. The data, data cleaning and methodology for performing sentiment analysis and topic modelling follow on from the literature review. The results of the descriptive analysis on the SONA speeches will then be presented and discussed. Finally, the conclusion summarises the important findings from this research.\nAdditionally, Chat GPT was used as an aid to this report. The purpose of this was to experiment with large language models and to assess Chat GPT’s ability to assist with the research and the report itself. A brief summary of its performance and how it responded to different prompts and guides is given as an addendum to the report (see the Use of ChatGPT tab of this website)."

    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\n\nSentiment Analysis\nSentiment analysis is a technique to programmatically assess the emotional content of a text (Silge & Robinson, 2017). It provides a way, through the use of sentiment lexicons, to understand the attitudes and opinions expressed in a piece of text or speech and identify if they are positive or negative (Silge & Robinson, 2017). Sentiment analysis is seen as a classification method as it classifies documents into positive or negative categories or more sophisticated classes such as joy, disgust or anger, depending on the specific sentiment lexicon used in the analysis (Medhat et al., 2014). Due to the increasingly large amounts of text data around today, sentiment analysis has become more popular and necessary as a tool for document classification and arrangement as the task has become manually impractical (Medhat et al., 2014). There are a number of application areas for sentiment analysis including customer feedback and reviews, social media monitoring, market research and political analysis. In the context of the SONA data, the sentiment analysis can be seen as a form of political analysis and a way in which to describe how the country progressed in terms of governance and economy from 1994 to 2023.\n\n\nTopic Modelling\nTopic Modelling is a unsupervised classification technique for grouping documents according to topic or theme (Silge & Robinson, 2017). The particular topic modelling method that is popular in the literature is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Silge & Robinson, 2017). The key ideas of this method is to consider documents as a collection of topics and topics as a collection of words (Silge & Robinson, 2017). Topic modelling, allows one to categorize documents into broad themes and calculate the proportions of each topic or theme that appear in a document. Miranda and Bringula (2021) used Topic Modelling to analsye the SONA speeches of Philippine presidents. Through the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, they were able to identify three major topics each linked with concerns within the country. In general, a topic can be labelled by assessing the sentences that contain the words in that topic. Miranda & Bringula (2021) emphasise that this process needs to be thoroughly discussed and a general consensus has to be reached on what labels best represent each topic. This gives an indication that selecting the labels for topics is not always an easy task and may in some instances not represent perfectly the true underlying topic found by the LDA analysis."

    "section": "Data",
    "text": "Data\nAs mentioned, the data for this analysis is a collection of 36 speeches delivered as State of the Nation Addresses between 1994 and 2022. These speeches were delivered by 6 different presidents: de Klerk, Mandela, Mbeki, Motlanthe, Zuma and Ramaphosa.\nThis data needed to be cleaned before sentiment analysis or topic modelling could be done. The data was cleaned by removing punctuation marks and numbers from the speeches. Stop words, which are common words such as ‘the’, ‘and’ and ‘they’ were also removed from the speeches.\nIn order to perform sentiment analysis the speeches needed to be tokenized into shorter parts such as bigrams and words in order to assess the sentiment of each smaller part and then aggregate these sentiments to understand the sentiment of the speech as a whole. The speeches are tokenized first into sentences and then into words using the unnest_tokens() function in R.\nA separate analysis is done on bigrams in order to consider negation of words, for example ‘improvement’ vs ‘no improvement’, and to assess how frequently negation occurred. In order to perform this analysis the unnest_tokens() function was used specifying the token argument to ‘ngrams’ and setting ‘n’ to 2. The same cleaning was done in order to remove numbers and punctuation marks before the speeches were tokenized in this way. In terms of stop word removal, stop words were removed except for those stop words that are negation words. The qdapDictionary::negation.words dictionary was used to identify negation words and remove them from the stop words before removing stop words from the analysis.\nFor topic modelling, for which Latent Dirichlet allocation will be applied, the data format that will be used is a DocumentTermMatrix object. Once the speeches have been tokenized and cleaned, as was done above, a DTM object is created using the cast_dtm() function which is part of the tidytext package in R. The cast_dtm() function is applied to the data frame containing the words, speechIDs and counts and turns the data frame into a DTM object using these variables."

    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\n\nSentiment Analysis\nIn order to perform sentiment analysis, sentiment lexicons are used. These lexicons contain many words which are labelled according to their sentiment. The main lexicon that was made use of here for analysis was the bing dictionary which labels words as positive or negative. The affin dictionary gives each word a score between negative five and five, from negative to positive sentiments.\nIn order to get each words sentiment, the data frame containing individual words, with an associated president, year and sentence ID is left joined with the bing lexicon in order to get their associated positive or negative sentiment. Because many of the words in the speeches are not in the dictionary, these words are assigned with a sentiment value of neutral instead of removing them from analysis. This is not an ideal situation as it may mean that words which are very emotively loaded are being assigned as neutral and so one could miss the true sentiment of a sentence or speech however it is better than removing all these words from the analysis completely.\nIn order to analyze the sentiment of different presidents we can consider each presidents most commonly used positive and negative words which can be found using filtering by president and filtering by positive or negative sentiment.\nIn addition one can consider how sentiment changes over time and by president by considering the number of positive and negative sentiment associated words and seeing how this changes over time. This can also be done using the filter() function and filtering by year. In this way one can see if the percentage of positive sentiment in a speech increased or decreased as well as identify the net sentiment of the SONA speeches over time.\nSentiment analysis, with unigram tokens, can effectively capture the sentiment associated with a word. However, there are instances where negation words precede these sentiments. Negation words are words that reverse the sentiment of a succeeding word in sentiment analysis, essentially reversing its polarity (AlGhamdi, 2022). In unigram-based sentiment analysis, it becomes necessary to account for this reversal in sentiment when negation words are present. Bigrams, which are pairs of consecutive words, prove to be valuable in investigating this phenomenon. Analyzing negation in conjunction with unigram sentiment helps assess whether some positive or negative sentiments might be incorrectly classified and whether the most frequently used positive/negative words truly represent a polar sentiment to the realization discussed.\nThe negation words used here have been drawn from the dictionary provided by (Rinker, T. W., 2013). It is important to note that this list of negation words is not exhaustive, and this limitation could affect the outcomes of the analysis.\nIn cases where a bigram contained a negation word as the first of the two words, the sentiment was reversed. Afterward, an overall sentiment score was computed for each bigram to determine the sentiment associated with it.\n\n\nTopic Modelling\nThe second technique used to analyze the State of the Nation Addresses is topic modelling for which Latent Dirichlet allocation is used. The basic components of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are as follows:\n\nEach document (in this case speech) is made up of a mixture of topics.\nEach topic is made up of a mixture of words.\n\nIf one wanted to generate a speech, first the number of words to generate must be specified. Following that one makes a draw from a Dirichlet distribution which gives a vector of proportions of each topic in the document. Then one divides up the number of words between the topics in the proportions specified. The words are then drawn from a conditional distribution which gives the probability of word i appearing given that the topic is topic j. LDA is therefore a hierarchical model, sampling first the topic proportions and then sampling the words given the topic proportions.\nThe topicmodels package is used in R in order to perform LDA on the SONA data using the LDA() function. A seed of 2023 is set within the LDA control argument in order to ensure results are reproducible. The LDA() function takes in as arguments the DocumentTermMatrix of the speeches, as discussed in the data section and a parameter k which specifies the number of topics one wants to obtain.\nIn terms of selecting the number of topics to look for, this has to be specified in the LDA() function when it is run. Miranda and Bringula (2021) selected three topics in analyzing the Philippines SONA speeches. For this analysis: two, three and four topics were considered. It was found that four topics was best and were easiest to categorize into understandable labels. For this reason the majority of topic modelling results presented below are based on the four topic case.\nIt was found that in many cases the same words were appearing in many topics, particularly more common words like ‘government’, ‘africa’ and ‘people’. In order to make the individual topics more meaningful these repeated words were set to only be allowed to be within one topic. This helped make the topics more unique so that better topic labels could be identified for each."

    "section": "Results and Discussion",
    "text": "Results and Discussion\nHaving outlined the methods used to perform sentiment analysis and topic modelling, the results and analysis of the speeches is now given.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nIndividual Words\nFigure 1 below shows the most common positive words used by each president. A number of words stand out here. “Regard” is used very frequently by Mandela, Mbeki and Motlanthe while Zuma and Ramaphosa both say “support” often. Mandela and de Klerk’s most common words are similar in terms of theme, examples being “freedom”, “peaceful” and “reconciliation”. These types of positive words are expected from these two presidents who were in office at the end of apartheid in South Africa.\nIt can also be noted that Ramaphosa and Zuma share similar positive words including “reform”, “improve”, “sustainable” and “progress” which indicates where much of their positive focus lies introducing new reforms or advocating for economic improvements and sustainable economic policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The most commonly used positive words used by each president.\nFigure 2 below shows the most frequently used negative word by each president. Again here, as with the positive sentiment words, a couple words stand out which can highlight what the major issues at the time of each presidency. For Mbeki and Motlanthe, the most common negative sentiment word is “poverty” which indicates that that was a large problem at the time of their presidency or a negative aspect of the country that was focused on significantly in their speeches. Ramaphosa and Zuma use “corruption” many times in their speeches and this again points to what was regarded by them as a major negative issue to be addressed. In addition to corruption they both also speak of crime and poverty fairly frequently.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The most commonly used negative words used by each president.\nHaving considered overall the most commonly used positive and negative words by each president which gives an idea of what the positive and negative issues of the country were at the time, sentiment changes over time are now considered. Figure A and B in Appendix 1 give the changes in positive and negative sentiment associated words over time. Figure 3 below gives the net change in sentiment overtime, where each president is represented by a different symbol shown in the legend. This net sentiment shows the net positive sentiments over negative sentiments. It is clear that overall most presidents have net positive speeches, using more positive than negative words. An exception to this is de Klerk where the value is just less than zero indicating more negative words than positive ones were said. In addition, Mandela’s 1998 speech had an almost equal amount of negative and positive words. It must again be noted that those words not present in the bing dictionary were set as neutral and so there may be words present in the speech that would slightly change these net sentiment values.\nMbeki and Ramaphosa stand out as having the highest net positive sentiment. Between 2003 and 2005 the SONA speeches were significantly more positive than negative during Mbeki’s presidency. Ramaphosa’s 2019 State of the Nation address also has a high net positive value. This was the year that Ramaphosa was elected as president and before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and so it makes intuitive sense that this specific speech of Ramaphosa’s was the largest in net positive sentiment as it was likely a hopeful speech talking about change that would come after Zuma’s presidency and attempted impeachment.\nThe speeches from 2020 to 2023 decreased significantly in net positive sentiment which makes sense due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact on the country. However, these SONA speeches were still overall more positive than negative, but not as positive as Ramaphosa first official SONA as president (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Net positive sentiment in speeches over the years.\nFigure 4 below gives the change in net positive sentiment over each of the presidents terms in office. For de Klerk and Motlanthe, this is not applicable because they each only delivered one address. Mandela and Mbeki became increasingly positive in their speeches over their presidencies while Zuma and Ramaphosa delivered speeches that were less and less positive. It is expected that Mandela and Mbeki would have become increasingly more positive as their presidencies covered a time in which democracy was new in South Africa and significant changes made in government from the apartheid era which increased positive sentiment in the country. In the case of Zuma, a decrease in positive sentiment makes sense as particularly toward the end of his presidency he was facing numerous allegations of corruption which likely would have impacted his speech sentiment. As already mentioned, the second year of Ramaphosa’s presidency saw the start of the pandemic which would have decreased the amount of positive sentiment in his speeches.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Change in Net Positive Sentiment between first and last speech, for each president.\n\n\nBigrams\nThe bigram sentiment analysis results are now presented and discussed. Three bigram sets are shown here, those that convey positive sentiment, those that convey negative sentiment and bigrams containing negated words.\nIn Figure 5, each president seems to have a number of repeating phrases that are meant to convey positive sentiment. These all seem to be rather unique to each individual. Both president’s Ramaphosa and Zuma speak upon “land reform”, a very polarising topic dependent on who is asked. For those who have suffered the backlash of Apartheid, land reform is a very positive sentiment, however, for many who own land, land reform is a very negative sentiment. However, it is understandable that this has been given a positive sentiment overall as the word reform means to improve upon.\nAlthough these are supposed to be the presidents’ positive sentiments, characters like de Klerk and Zuma do not subjectively convey a lot of positivity. Their statements are rather neutral. Their positive sentiment cannot be translated well. This may be a result of there not being many positive items that they could have hoped to address. The bing dictionary may also not be a good dictionary for these two. De Klerk did, however, have a lot of positive sentiment about the “freedom alliance”.\nRamaphosa’s positive sentiment seems to be very hopeful. He talks about plans, progress and steps forward. These ideas are indicative of a process or belief of a process to betterment. Mandela’s positive sentiment worked around ideas of humanity. The reconcilliation commission, national unity, human dignity and affirmative action are all ideas that were professed in hopes of establishing a cooperative and friendlier social environment. Mbeki was very focused on the improvement of the country’s economic status. Most of his positive sentiment includes words that invoke the idea of an increasing economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The most commonly used positive bigrams used by each president.\nIn Figure 6, each president seems to have a number of repeating phrases that are meant to convey negative sentiment. Both Motlanthe and Mbeki happen to have very similar ideas in terms of their negative sentiment bigrams. This is understandable as Motlanthe took office after the resignation of Mbeki. It seems by looking at these plots of negative sentiment that these two presidents were dealing with crime and poverty.\nSome of these sentiments in the negative plot are in fact quite positive and this shows a limitation of sentiment analysis. This shows how not every negation can be accounted for. For example, bigrams like criminal justice, poverty alleviation and anti corruption, have been shown to hold a negative meaning. These bigrams however have positive connotations. Anti corruption is the fight against something quite bad, that is corruption; criminal justice is the fight against crime; poverty alleviation is the mitigation of poverty. All these sentiments have been categorized as negative where in fact their meaning is quite positive. Such a realization puts into context some limitations that come about from the use of dictionaries that may have value some of these positive or negative as neutral, or not valued them at all. A similar limitation can be seen looking at Motlanthe and de Klerk with phrases such as “metric poverty” and “hard negotiations” being classified as negative when these may be neutral terms stating facts.\nDuring Zuma’s presidency, the negative sentiment that was expressed was undeniably negative. It seemed to be a period had greater amounts of corruption as the word corruption appears frequently in the bigrams. Apart from the attempt to combat corruption, the sentiment in Zuma’s speeches does not seem to have any double meaning. The speaker seems to speak on the financial and economic crisis present in the country at the time.\nRamaphosa’s negative sentiment is rather ambiguous. It is clear that at this time a very frequent topic was railways, employment, corruption and equality. The word rail has been given negative sentiment while it’s accompanying words are either neutral or not defined in the bing dicitonary. It may not exactly be accurate to say that this rail is a negative sentiment. That along with critical skill and critical role, demonstrates that Ramaphosa’s negative bigram sentiments were not able to capture the true meaning behind his statements.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The most commonly used negative bigrams used by each president.\nFigure C, D and E in the Appendix show the use of negations in bigrams to identify if any positive or negative words are frequently negated. It can be seen that negation words do not appear frequently in these speeches or in front of other words. This is an important observation particularly for both the positive and negative individual words identified above. The fact that the negation of these positive and negative sentiments happens infrequently indicates that on the whole the positive and negative words identified are used within the correct context and are not negated.\n\n\n\nTopic Modelling\nHaving considered the sentiment analysis results of each speech, the topic modelling results are now presented.\nAs mentioned in the methods section, in order to specify an LDA model, one has to specify the number of topics one could expect to see in a document. Having selected this number of topics, the LDA will produces two outputs beta, \\(\\beta\\), and gamma, \\(\\gamma\\). Where \\(\\beta\\) is a parameter that gives the probability of a topic generating a particular word and \\(\\gamma\\) gives the proportions of topics in a document (Durbach, I., 2023).\nWe first look into the \\(\\beta\\)’s, the word-topic probabilities. To find a decent number of topics we ran 2, 3 and 4 topics in the LDA function and found that 4 topics gives the best result of the option. Both 2 and 3 topics had topics that had almost the same words as well as words with very similar meanings or themes. Although it is possible for topics to share some terms and meaning, the similarity of terms between topics was so great that it was difficult to distinguish the topics at all. When 4 topics were used, there were much clearer distinctions between the topics which can be seen in Figure 7.\nIn Figure 7, it can be seen that although there still remains some common terms, such as “africa” and “african”, between some of the topics, majority of the words are unique to their topic. The words in each of the four topics seem to infer a potential idea or theme for each. Table 1 below gives the four topics along with their key words and sentences in which these words appear to help derive a meaningful label for each topic. This table may aid in demonstrating the meaning of each topic.\nTopic 1 contains words related to economic growth. This can be seen in how words like economy, investment, support, growth, sector and business fall into this topic. These are terms that are associated with economic behaviour and business.\nTopic 2 contains words related to social development. This can be seen with the inclusion of words such as people, development, ensure, regard, social and system. These words are related to social behaviour and the sentences containing these word speak about ‘social development’ and ‘community workers’.\nTopic 3 contains words related to public governance / government policy. This can be seen in the inclusion of words like government, public, service, nation, parliament and democracy. These are all aspects that are related to government involvement. Associated sentences to these words include ideas around government taking action and implementing programmes.\nTopic 4 contains words associated with ideas related to politics and administration. This topic is rather ambiguous, which resulted in it taking on two main ideas. On the side of politics there are words like national, Africa, honourable, president and chairperson. Some sentences associated with these words demonstrate a sense of pride and contain an encouragement to support political leaders. On the side of administration there are words like programme, million, infrastructure and water. Associated sentences refer to the work that needs to be done in terms of infrastructure in the country and some of the plans of government to implement changes in this regard.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Top 10 Terms in each Topic by word-topic probability.\nTable 1: Example sentences to aid in depicting the meaning of topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nLabel\nWords\nSentences\n\n\n\n\n1\nEconomic Growth\nEconomy, Investment, Growth, Business\n“The crisis cost our economy about 900 000 jobs.” “To ensure the promotion of an inclusive economy, to aid growth and development…” “As part of our efforts to encourage greater economic growth, we are working to reduce the cost to communicate.”\n\n\n2\nSocial Development\nPeople, Development, Social, Improve\n“We must sustain and improve the effectiveness of our social development programmes…” “The government will create a public service echelon of multi-skilled community development workers…”\n\n\n3\nPublic Governance\nGovernment, Public, Service, Democracy\n“That will provide an opportunity to address the more detailed issues on the government’s programme … that will support the government’s actions as our country begins its second decade of democracy.” “In particular we have decided that this year the government itself, in all its spheres, and the public sector as a whole, must make a decisive and integrated contribution…”\n\n\n4\nPolitics and Administration\nNational, Compatriots, President, Infrastructure\n“Compatriots and esteemed guests, local government must work.” “We dare not allow any minority to deprive the great majority South Africans of their long-awaited desire to elect national and provincial governments which will for the first time in our history be truly representative of all South Africans.” “Over the next few years, there will be a dramatic expansion … for water, land care, municipal infrastructure...”\n\n\n\nHaving considered the word-topic probabilities, the document-topic probabilities, \\(\\gamma\\)’s, can now be considered which will give an indication of how much each president spoke about the four topics and if and how this changes over time. As mentioned previously the document-topic probabilities describe each document as a mixture of topics. It is helpful to analyze the proportions of a topic present in the document to understand the main theme of each speech and identify which topics were of most importance to each president.\nIn Figure 8, these \\(\\gamma\\)’s are captured across the speeches allowing the visualization of trend in topic over time for each president. This would aid in identifying what the general idea of the speech at a given time was. The speeches given by de Klerk and Motlanthe are not in this plot because they each only gave one speech so changes over time cannot be considered.\nMandela’s speeches was very focused on ideas of politics and admin. This makes sense as this was a period of transformation in government. Policy and administration were two very important points that needed to be tackled to escape the previously oppressive and hateful era. This emphasis on protecting the new government structure and politics is further reflected in how the topics of public governance are also strongly occurring topics in his speeches. Interesting the economic growth topic does not appear here. This shows a limitation of this analysis, because while Mandela may not have spoken about economic growth as much as later presidents, it definitely would have been part of his speeches and so should have been more present here.\nThe plot for Mbeki shows a much larger amount of change in topics between different speeches. In each of his speeches the dominating topic seems to shift. In his first and third speeches, he seems to talk on politics and administration. In his second and sixth speech, his dominating topic is that of social development. His fifth, eighth and ninth speeches deal with government policy. His fourth and seventh speech have a combination of ideas these different topics. In his last years of presidency, the main theme of his speeches was that of social development.\nZuma’s speeches revolve around two topics, economic growth and government policy. The plot shows that most of his speeches changed between having one of these two topics as his main theme and they often switched in terms of which was more important over consecutive years.\nAlmost every speech that Ramaphosa has given strongly deals with the topics of economic growth, this is shown in the dominating document-topic probabilities of the topic over all of Ramphosa’s speeches. This makes intuitive sense as much of Ramaphosa’s presidency has been during the COVID-19 pandemic which had a large negative impact on the economy, thus requiring a need for economic growth and stimulation in the country. In his last two speeches it would seem that he gave more attention to politics and administration, while still focusing heavily on economic growth.\nIn de Klerk’s single speech, he spoke about two topics. Topic 1 with a \\(\\gamma\\) value of 0.468 and Topic 4 with a \\(\\gamma\\) value of 0.532. His focus was therefore on both economic growth and politics and administration with slightly more of a focus on the latter topic. In Motlanthe’s speech he had a \\(\\gamma\\) value of 1 for topic 2 which indicates that his speech primarily focused on social development. This makes sense as Motlanthe followed on from Mbeki whose last speeches also primarily focused on social development.\nTopic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation has allowed for four key themes to be picked up in the SONA data from 1994 to 2023. These key topics have been outlined and have been able to be tracked over time. As mentioned there are some limitation in this analysis which include the fact that some topics contain words that convey similar meaning to words in other topics. This makes it challenging to identify labels and the labels identified here may not be exactly in line with what the true underlying topic may have been. Despite this, topic modelling gives one the ability to identify possible themes in each speech without requiring one to have listened to or read the whole speech. This makes topic modelling, and specifically LDA, a useful method as it automates the analysis of large volumes of text data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The trend in topic over time for each president’s speeches."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis report has outlined a descriptive analysis of the State of the Nation speeches in South Africa between 1994 and 2023. This descriptive analysis was carried out by implementing sentiment analysis and topic modelling on the speech data. This analysis has highlighted the importance of being able to manipulate and wrangle text data in order to convert it into useful formats. In addition it has shown how both sentiment analysis and topic modelling are useful tools to extract meaning from text data without having to read through the full speeches. The sentiment analysis showed the positive or negative sentiments of each president and described how these sentiments changed over time. Significant increases or decreases in positive sentiment were also able to be noted. The topic modelling technique pulled out four topics that the presidents conveyed in their speeches. These topics were able to be tracked over time for each president which gave insight into which topics different presidents thought were more or less important to speak about. There are some limitations to the analysis that has been done such as the lack of certain words in the sentiment lexicons and assumptions of ‘neutral’ words. In addition, for the topic modelling, there is no set number of topics that should be chosen and so a potential limitation is not conducting more analysis with varying numbers of topics. Overall, this report has given an overview of how to conduct a descriptive analysis of text data and has highlighted two popular techniques, sentiment analysis and topic modelling."

    "text": "ChatGPT, a large language model, was used in this assignment to assisst in identifying problem areas and resolving shortcomings. Various types of requests were submitted; the performance of these requests were variable. This is further explained below.\nOpen ended questions/Asking for guidance:\nThe first type of questions asked to ChatGPT were broad questions seeking guidance and direction. For example: “What is the best way to perform sentiment analysis of speeches in R?” or “What are the major application areas for sentiment analysis?”. In response to these types of questions ChatGPT was quite helpful, offering lists with valueable information, which aided in giving direction on what to do or write about in the report. This included giving steps one could follow in R with associated code, as well as lists of application areas with brief descriptions of how sentiment analysis is applied.\nProviding literature:\nThe second task attempted with ChatGPT involved requesting recommendations for academic papers and textbooks to assist in the formation of the literature review. Questions asked were “Can you recommend papers or textbooks on sentiment analysis for the purpose of a literature review?” and “Please also provide some papers for a brief literature review for Topic Modelling? Particularly any papers that have done topic modelling for presidential speeches”. While some of the recommended papers proved to be valuable and contained the desired information, certain issues were encountered. In some cases, the suggested papers appeared not to exist, or their authors differed from those specified by ChatGPT. In addition, a number of machine learning papers related to sentiment analysis were recommended, which, while potentially interesting, might not align with the basic sentiment analysis information one might be seeking. To address these challenges, it is essential to provide more specific criteria or instructions in the query to refine the search and obtain more accurate recommendations.\nAssistance with code:\nA number of prompts were given to ChatGPT regarding code and how to fix errors in R or create certain plots. This is one area that ChatGPT performs well in. It is able to take a request and produce chunks of code that execute the task. One area that ChatGPT did not do particularly well in was identifying why a particular error was occurring in R. For example with the S4 objects that are created when an LDA analysis is performed, ChatGPT did not know that the $ operator cannot be used with S4 objects. Even after providing it the R error which specifies that this is the case, it still failed produce correct code. The prompt had to be modified to specify that this is the case and request the correct operator before ChatGPT was able to give the correct code.\nAssistance with write up:\nThe final item tasked to ChatGPT was to assess its ability to aid in writing up some of the report. The tool was prompted to with the introduction of the paper and asked to edit it in a manner that was ‘better’ for scientific papers. This is one area where it did not perform particularly well. While it is able to write and generate text that makes sense and well structured, the language used is quite ‘flowery’ and abundant in redundant words. This makes it very obvious that it was written by a Large Language Model as it does not convey the same tone that an academic would have. These responses were not used in the report because the responses were not particularly good.\nIn summary, it was observed that ChatGPT serves as a valuable tool for generating ideas and code when one is uncertain about a course of action. However, it is essential to exercise caution and not blindly accept all of its suggestions without verification. In addition, some of its suggested ‘fixes’ may not function as intended, and prompts provided should be specific to guide the Large Language Model in the right direction.\nA link to some of the questions used is given here:\nChatGPT Conversation"

    "text": "Due to the large volume of text data available today, sentiment analysis and topic modelling have become popular methods to classify documents (or other pieces of text) based on their emotional content and topics or themes present. Sentiment analysis and topic modelling methods provide techniques to programmatically categorize documents and does not require individuals to sit and read through large documents. In this report, sentiment analysis and topic modelling is applied to State of the Nation Addresses in South Africa between 1994 and 2023. The sentiment analysis sectiosn allows one to identify different presidents’ sentiments conveyed in their speeches and how this changed over time. Topic modelling highlights what the major themes are that each president speaks about and if the proportion of time spent on each topic changes over time. The results of the sentiment analysis showed that, overall, South African presidents have a net positive sentiment in their speeches. Specifically, Mandela and Mbeki became more positive in their speeches over the time of their presidency while Zuma and Ramaphosa has become less positive during their time in office. These findings correlate with what was happening in South Africa at the times of their respective presidencies. Topic modelling extracted four key topics or themes which were given the following labels: Economic Growth, Social Development, Public Governance and Politics and Administration. The four topics were tracked over time for each president and results show how different presidents’ different speeches contained varying levels of each of these four topics."
